116,My child is showing signs of lgbtq what should I do,"First you try to accept them as they are .When your children come out to you about their gender identity or sexuality, it can be a big step for them. One that's filled with fear, anxiety about your reaction, and hope that you will love them no matter what you are about to say. You need to believe your child and make this known to them. It is easy to assume clichés or go into a space of denial by saying things like ""it's just a phase"" or ""they're confused,"" especially if your child is young. However, saying these words can irreparably damage your relationship with them.

159,I have a feeling that my teenage child/son/daughter have gone through love failure,"Your first reaction might be to shower your child with well-meaning, placating statements, such as “you can do better” or “they weren’t right for you anyway.” You’ll probably want to tell them that they're too young to be so seriously involved, or fall back on the ultimate relationship cliché: “There are plenty of fish in the sea.” But these sentiments are generally unhelpful.Saying ""I told you so"" about a partner you had warned them against is not helpful or supportive, either. Criticizing your teen's ex will likely just make them feel worse. And they're likely to be defensive and less interested in confiding in you.Keep these in your mind before speaking with your child they are,1. Validate Your Teen’s Emotions
2. Support Your Teen's Decision

161,My teenage child/son/daughter always uses phone especially at night,"As long as she's not buying or selling things on the black market or doing other illegal activity I wouldn't worry about it. That was sarcastic of course because the chances of her doing that are basically none. I guess I would mainly be concerned that she's getting sleep. If I caught her on the phone at 3am in the morning I'd be upset because she needs sleep. I'd take her phone at night if she isn't sleeping well and getting bad grades.I would talk to her about online predators and mention to her the tactics they use and to not share personal information with strangers. If she's exploring her sexuality it's not that big of a deal as long as you explain to her the dangers of real life sex and have a good idea of where she's going when she goes out. If she's exploring her sexuality, taking her phone away won't help. She can get that stuff from everywhere these days. You'd only be limiting her access really.Call her when she's out to make sure everything's going okay and to remind her to be careful/safe."

165,My teenage child feels happy with others failures I am scared how to cure it,"It is because of jealousy the things which they can't do are achieved by others .We get a hit of dopamine after any pleasure in life: delicious food, drugs, falling in love, sex, praise, winning a competition, most anything that feels good. And as it turns out our brains release dopamine when something bad happens to someone we envy.So tell your child to not focus on others and improve themselves .By having jealousy nothing will improve.If you don't stop know it will turn into sadistic behaviour"
166,My teenage child tells me I am interfering too much in their lives,"We must also take into account that the parents' attitude can be quite bad for the children and that sometimes, children should take their own decisions.

169,My teenage child is Constant Whining and Complaining,"It is important to know that the pure reason for complaining and whining is that your kid wants to know whether you are paying attention to him or not. It is best to talk with him the moment you hear him complain and offer a solution quickly. Gradually, educate him in communicating his issues the right way instead of whining all the time. Talk to him about how he himself can resolve certain problems of his own."

189,How do I convince my children to stay with me after the divorce?,"It is the children's own choices. The parents will soon realized that the children are no more kids. They are also very smart and willing to raise their voices. It is painful to hear their side of the outcome. It is best for the parents not to keep any secrets, cause the kids will anyway heard about the dark sides of their parents from relatives and friends. Then they are emotional stronger to handle the situation.What you shouldn’t do, is treat you’re children like a therapist. You shouldn’t talk wrong, about the other parent. You also should let them pick, who they live with. You’ve got a better chance then, that’s what I think. I obviously don’t know you’re kids, so I don’t know for sure. But if you start treating them, as you’re therapist. I don’t think they’ll want to live with you.Unless the other parent is abusive, there is no reason to convince your children to stay with you after divorcing their other parent. Don't talk about the other parent, funny badmouth them. Don't punish the other parent just because your relationship didn't work.
Remember: the children come first, and sometimes that means taking our own ego out of the equation. What's best for them and what's best for us isn't always the same thing, and the children love both their parents. It's damaging to take the kids away from their other parent unless it's absolutely necessary.Mostly chose joint parenting"

191,How do I divorce without hurting my child?,"Separation and divorce are emotionally difficult events, but it is possible to have a healthy breakup.The end of a marriage typically unleashes a flood of emotions including anger, grief, anxiety and fear. Sometimes these feelings can rise up when you least expect them, catching you off guard. Such a response is normal, and over time the intensity of these feelings will subside. In the meantime, be kind to yourself. Researchers have found that people who are kind and compassionate to themselves have an easier time managing the day-to-day difficulties of divorce.Try not to think of the breakup as a battle. Divorce mediation is often a good alternative to courtroom proceedings. Trying to work things out yourself can be frustrating and self-defeating as the problems that contributed to your divorce are likely to re-emerge during divorce negotiations. Research shows that mediation can be beneficial for emotional satisfaction, spousal relationships and children’s needs.Divorce can be a traumatic experience for children, but research suggests that most children adjust well within two years following the divorce; on the other hand, children often experience more problems when parents remain in high-conflict marriages instead of splitting up.4 During a divorce, parents can do a lot to ease the child’s transition. Do your best to keep any conflict away from the kids. Ongoing parental conflict increases kids’ risk of psychological and social problems.11
Healthy Divorce
No one enters into a marriage expecting it to fail. Still, more than 20 percent of first marriages end in divorce within five years, and 48 percent of marriages dissolve by the 20-year mark, according to 2006-2010 data from the government’s National Survey of Family Growth.1 Separation and divorce are emotionally difficult events, but it is possible to have a healthy breakup.
Cooperation, communication and mediation
The end of a marriage typically unleashes a flood of emotions including anger, grief, anxiety and fear. Sometimes these feelings can rise up when you least expect them, catching you off guard. Such a response is normal, and over time the intensity of these feelings will subside. In the meantime, be kind to yourself. Researchers have found that people who are kind and compassionate to themselves have an easier time managing the day-to-day difficulties of divorce.2

Try not to think of the breakup as a battle. Divorce mediation is often a good alternative to courtroom proceedings. Trying to work things out yourself can be frustrating and self-defeating as the problems that contributed to your divorce are likely to re-emerge during divorce negotiations. Research shows that mediation can be beneficial for emotional satisfaction, spousal relationships and children’s needs.3

Sitting down and speaking with your soon-to-be-ex-spouse may be the last thing you want to do, but cooperation and communication make divorce healthier for everyone involved. Talking things through with a psychologist may help you reach coordinated decisions with a minimum of conflict.

It can be difficult to remember important details when emotions are running high. Pick a time when you’re feeling calm to write down all the points you want to discuss. When you do sit down with your soon-to-be-ex-spouse, use the list as your guide. Having a “script” to work from can take some of the emotion out of face-to-face communication. If in-person discussions are still too difficult, consider handling some of the details over email.

When kids are involved
Divorce can be a traumatic experience for children, but research suggests that most children adjust well within two years following the divorce; on the other hand, children often experience more problems when parents remain in high-conflict marriages instead of splitting up.4 During a divorce, parents can do a lot to ease the child’s transition. Do your best to keep any conflict away from the kids. Ongoing parental conflict increases kids’ risk of psychological and social problems.It’s often helpful for divorcing parents to come up with a plan and present it to their children together. And, keep the lines of communication open. Kids benefit from having honest conversations about the changes their family is experiencing.In many cases, sudden change can be hard on children. If appropriate, give them a few weeks’ notice before moving them to a new home, or before one spouse moves out. It can be helpful to minimize changes as much as possible in the months and years following a divorce.Kids do better when they maintain close contact with both parents. Research suggests that kids who have a poor relationship with one or both parents may have a harder time dealing with family upheaval. Parent education programs that focus on improving the relationship between parents and their kids have been shown to help children cope better in the months and years following the divorce."

244,Is it OK to not enjoy parenting?,"Yes, it's normal to be annoyed by parenting—and by your kids—sometimes. But some people are more likely than others to find themselves struggling to find joy in parenting—for starters, anyone who is prone to depression and anxiety"
245,Am I being too poor to satisfy my children needs,"Poor in what way?

Emotionally poor, like being a narcissist? Do the child a favor and first get therapy and heal those wounds.

Spiritually poor? Do the child a favor and wait until you have matured and become less selfish before having kids.

Lacking education? If you have career goals, maybe wait until you achieve those goals. It is possible to balance a family with going to high school/ college/ trade school, but it is difficult. Why make life harder than it needs to be?

Socially poor? Is your co-parent going to be irresponsible, aloof, or unable to help you? Are you in a shaky relationship with your partner? Are your parents and friends supportive? It is a lot easier to raise a kid if you have a village looking forward to helping you.

Now, the part that is controversial: how much money do you need before having a child?

No one can answer that question, but let’s think about what is in the best interest of the kid, who did not consent to being born into this world— a world full of suffering.

I think parents should strive to excel spiritually, emotionally, intellectually, financially, and socially before having kids. Why? Because the whole point of having kids is raising good future adults. If parents have unresolved issues, struggles, or challenges, then it makes it harder for them to give the kid what the kid deserves. It is not fair to the kid. Children deserve a good role model. It would be great if the parent can teach the kid financial literacy from a young age— it really gives the kid an advantage in life.

Of course, everyone is free to make their own choices. I think the better choice is to wait until one is ready to be a parent."

319,Is my child lesbian,"People often think of lesbians as having short-hair, their upper lips unwaxed, their clothes manly, their behaviour closely resembling a man. While this is true of some lesbians, it is not true for others.So if your daughter does not wear saris and salwar kameezes or wears baggy jeans with flannel shirts, don’t assume that she’s a lesbian. On the other hand, if your daughter does dress in a very feminine manner and has a beauty parlour appointment every 2 weeks, that doesn’t mean she is straight.Not very helpful, I know. What can I say – there is nothing really that makes someone a lesbian other than their attraction to women. The culture in India makes it even harder to guess one’s sexuality, because there is so much affection between people of the same gender.So pay attention to your child. This does not mean that you should rifle through her stuff or try to hack into her email account or pick up the extension phone and eavesdrop on her phone calls."

Your teen is likely dealing with raging hormones, rising responsibilities, and navigating the social dynamics of high school. But this does not mean your teen should lounge around the house, fail to get her chores done, and miss deadlines for school assignments. Laziness in most teens can be adjusted by creating solid rules for your teen and sticking to them, motivating your teen to get chores and other commitments done, and talking to your teen about any issues or problems she may be having at school or at home.Check in with your teen to see if there's an underlying cause. Stress, depression, and sleep problems can negatively affect motivation.

Do I see my child as much as possible or very little? Is it more confusing for the child?","Hi, your situation sounds very complicated and sensitive.  It is important to handle it with care as it involves your children.  When parents are attempting to co-parent, the clearer the boundaries and expectations are the easier it gets to effectively co-parent.  Parenting your child is not “living in the past”, allow me to reframe that approach and instead view it as an investment in your future.  Your child will forever be your child and deserves and active loving and caring father.  Staying away sends a different message to your child and leaves room for resentment.  Find a way to create an agreement between you and your ex-wife with the best interest of your child as the focus.  The courts are able to assist with this goal as well."

He had a baby with someone else he's with but still shows the same love he showed when we was together when he's around. He even gets jealous, but he ignores my calls.","Your story sounds like it gives you a great deal of tension and disappointment.You know you are not getting the amount of love and kind of relationship you'd like.It is almost as though you feel that ""something is better than nothing"".Reflect within yourself whether the balance of what you receive in this relationship is worth the sacrifice of not getting as much love as you wish.Depending on your decision you will know whether to drop this relationship or continue the same as its been."

My kid notices this how can I explain this situation to them","This sounds very painful for you.Are you able to tell him how his flirting affects you?Maybe he doesn't care enough to change, and maybe he does.Long term if he continues this then usually people feel they have two choices, put up with it, which of course greatly reduces the sense of satisfaction in the relationship.   Or, of course, you can decide to end the relationship.  This choice is quite significant now that you have a child together.  Give yourself plenty of time to think over the best outcome.

569,"My husband cheated while I was pregnant with our kid with a so-called friend. This was before we were married. We split and eventually worked things out. I thought I trusted him so we got married. Now he flirts with girls in front of me. I've talked to him, but nothing helps. My kid notices this how can I explain this situation to them","This sounds very painful for you.Are you able to tell him how his flirting affects you?Maybe he doesn't care enough to change, and maybe he does.Long term if he continues this then usually people feel they have two choices, put up with it, which of course greatly reduces the sense of satisfaction in the relationship.   Or, of course, you can decide to end the relationship.  This choice is quite significant now that you have a child together.  Give yourself plenty of time to think over the best outcome. Because if your husband continues this your child will be affected more in future."
570,"My husband still thinks about his ex-wife , and my son knows this because of this my son is disrespecting me how to deal with it","My answer is going to be super simplistic but I believe this may be what you need. Ask your husband if he wants to stay married to you.  If he says yes, then it would be helpful to go to a marriage counselor and work this out with a professional.  If he says no, then you can file for divorce. Because if it continues your child will be affected mentally and it will be reflected in his adult life"
571,"Every time I speak, he says I anger him. Also, when he’s mad at something, like work, he gets angry at me. I feel like we’re so distant from each other now. We used to laugh all the time, and I feel like he lets too much negativity in. What should I do? My kid gets affected.","It sounds to me like your husband is going through something, and I think you understand that. You might feel very helpless, sad, and disrespected at the same time. He's changed. It's unfair for him to blame you for his emotions. His mood issues are about him, not you, and he's either not recognising that or not taking responsibility for it. Are you respecting yourself here by drawing appropriate boundaries? You can let him know when you feel disrespected, and what's not okay with you.He may be experiencing depression, which often shows up as irritability in men. It could be that he's not telling you something, or he's unaware of his emotional processes. You can try a ""I'm really worried about you. You don't seem happy and I don't know how to help you. Some things are happening that aren't okay with me. Will you see a therapist?"" approach. Perhaps you could go with him the first time?  It's about a combination of compassion, self-respect and seeking professional help, I believe. If it does not work then file for divorce because if your kid watches your fighting it will affect thier mental health"

574,"My step son often watches me fight with my wife , will it affect the future","When parents repeatedly use hostile strategies with each other, some children can become distraught, worried, anxious, and hopeless.

Children can develop sleep disturbances and health problems like headaches and stomachaches, or they may get sick frequently. Their stress can interfere with their ability to pay attention, which creates learning and academic problems at school.

587,"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now he is depressed and hopeless again. I am afraid that it will affect my children life","Hello, and thank you for your question. This is a very serious time. I don't mean to frighten you, but you are right to be concerned. The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. It is very important, after hospitalization, to get follow-up care with a professional as soon as possible. If your husband has an established therapist, this is the time to call. It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling. This is good support for him AND you.It is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. Means really do matter.  So, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. You can't remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means he used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. This is where your support system can help out. People can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is over.If you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your husband about going back to the hospital. If he refuses, you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesn't want to. I know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save his life. Calling 9-1-1 is always a good option if you are not sure. Usually a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours or days. Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. But, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again. So, it is always good to have a plan. If you want more information, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They will always answer: 1-800-273-8255. They can help you create a specific safety plan. I do hope things work out alright. Be well."
588,"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now he is depressed and hopeless again. I am afraid that it will affect my children life","This is actually more common then we often realize, and actually understandable, as he has gone through a trauma, an unresolved existential crisis.  He was taken care of by others and now is again left alone with his own internal, and rather horrific inner struggle.In my work with CCT, or Contextual Conceptual Therapy, (see www.suicidetherapy.com) I have learned how trapped suicidal people are in their own isolation, also called a ""mysterious isolation,"" a form of self protection which cuts the off from their Self, or spirit.  And unless they address this message from their soul, accompany a guide on a journey to discover their own missing information, that is to recognize how their own uncomforted emotional pain has resulted in a coping stategy which has effectively cut themselves off from their own beauty, their Self, and their ability to receive love from themselves and others. Their attempt to kill themselves is a cry from their soul or spirit that they cannot live the life they are living any longer.  They take this literally and try to end their life, when in fact what their soul or spirit is saying is they need to begin to live the life they came here to live."
589,"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now he is depressed and hopeless again. I am afraid that it will affect my children life","I'm thankful to read your husband found care and that his suicide attempt wasn't successful.   While he was hospitalized, and prior to his release, your husband would've been provided in writing a self-care action plan. This typically includes things like committing to a contract 'not to harm' and what to do if he felt overwhelmed by his anger, depression, and hopelessness (e.g. call 112, call therapist, go to nearest hospital emergency department). Additionally, his protocol would've provided instructions for his taking medication(s) as directed, having a follow-up appointment(s) with his psychiatrist/psychologist/clinical social worker, and participating in some form of small group support.  If your husband's struggling as you describe, and you are feeling overwhelmed or frightened for his (your) safety, I'd encourage you to seek immediate assistance."
590,"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now he is depressed and hopeless again. I am afraid that it will affect my children life","This must be so difficult for both of you.  Watching someone you love suffer so profoundly can bring up lots of difficult feelings.  Without knowing what you are already doing, I have a few thoughts to share with you. First and foremost, know that you cannot fix this for him, and get support for yourself.As much as you are able, make space in your relationship for him to talk about what he is experiencing.  He might not want to talk, and that is ok.If he wants to talk, try to listen without judgement and without trying to talk him out of his feelings.  Focus on validating his feelings and just sitting with him in his pain.Let him know how you feel...that you love him, that you care, that you are concerned, that this is scary for you too, that you are here.I hope that this is helpful.  The techniques I've written about there may be supportive for you and your husband.  Sending warm wishes your way. "
591,"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now he is depressed and hopeless again. I am afraid that it will affect my children life","I appreciate that you are concerned about your husband's emotions and want to support him as best you can right now. I imagine that you must be going through your own difficult time too. You've had a complicated shock and trauma in your life and in your marriage; it's normal for both of your emotions to move from hope to despair to fear, anger, gratitude... there is no wrong way to feel and there is no particular pattern your emotions or his will follow. Try not to assume what he is feeling but ask him instead. ""How are you doing today?"" is something that can be asked over and over again and your love and compassion for him will come through. If he has a hard time talking, you can share your observations. ""I notice you're more withdrawn. This worries me."" Certainly it will help you if you know what he's thinking and feeling because he hid his intentions to hurt himself. It's normal that you want to know. If there is depression and hopelessness, this likely was part of what led to his initial despair. There is help out there. Depression is treatable, and seeking that treatment is important right now at this vulnerable time. This is the kind of complex situation that can be assisted by a therapist who is qualified to help you both understand and manage your emotions. Whether your wife seeks help or not, I hope that you do."
592,"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now he is depressed and hopeless again. I am afraid that it will affect my children life","A failed suicide attempt is commonly thought of as a “cry for help,” however it can also be a serious attempt to find a permanent solution to depression, hopelessness or other feelings a person feels are unbearable. It’s wonderful that you want to support your husband, but If your husband is feeling depressed and hopeless, you can best help him by getting him to a mental health professional. Feelings of hopelessness and depression, and previous attempts at suicide are all risk factors for future suicide attempts. With a mental health professional, or in the emergency room of a hospital, your husband should be evaluated for suicidal thoughts, intent and plan, and if he is a danger to himself he should probably be hospitalized again until he is stable. Without knowing the particulars, your husband may suffer from Major Depressive Disorder or some other illness on the depressive spectrum. In that case medication could help him immensely, at which point you can offer your support and encouragement him to practice gentle self-care. And do not forget to practice it for yourself.  Remember: a suicide attempt not only affects the person, but it is an immense stressor for his or her loved ones as well. As they say, “put your oxygen mask on first.” Then you will be better able to provide your husband with calm and loving care and attention."
593,"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now he is depressed and hopeless again. I am afraid that it will affect my children life","The fact that you're reaching out for help here is really helpful.The first thing I would suggest is that you consider seeing a local mental health professional yourself to be able to talk about the details, how this is affecting you, and how you can hold onto you are while also being supportive to you husband.From the way that you describe this, I wonder what has changed since coming home from the hospital. Perhaps you can have a conversation with your husband this and mention that you are asking him questions to learn more about his experience and you can discuss how you notice that things were going much better when he came home from the hospital, and now things are not as good. Perhaps he can tell you about what is different so that you may know him would be most helpful to him.I also hope that you husband is still continuing with his own treatment.There may also be a local peer support telephone number for the county that you live in that they be able to help you determine whether your husband needs more immediate treatment if he is feeling hopeless again."
594,"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now he is depressed and hopeless again. I am afraid that it will affect my children life","Since as husband and wife your lives are closely joined, how your husband feels greatly influences the way you feel.Give yourself some time to concentrate on how you've been affected by your husband's suicide attempt.   Even if you decide against immediately telling him how you're feeling, knowing this about yourself will guide how and the topics you bring up with him.Is your husband talking easily with you?Do you have some ideas as to what is creating his feeling of hopelessness?The ideal approach would be if the two of you are able to discuss what bothers him and what bothers you.Depending on how far away you each are from such a position, you may benefit from speaking with a licensed professional therapist who can guide you and or you and your husband on opening up for discussion what feels stressful enough to merit taking one's own life."
595,"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now he is depressed and hopeless again. I am afraid that it will affect my children life","It seems like you are very receptive of your husband’s emotions and want to support him trough this time.  But it is also important of being aware of your emotions.  How are you feeling after the suicide attempt?  It is common to experience negative feelings while you try to make sense of the incident.  Feelings like anger, shame, guilt and fear are frequent; while, wanting to avoid, minimize and become distant from the person are parts of the defense mechanism to attempt a quick resolution.  Once you understand and overcome those feelings you may be in a better position to help your husband; who may be experiencing some negative feelings as well.First, it is important to have a safety plan in place, which includes removing harming objects from the home, knowing who to call if there’s a new attempt (either 112, or nearby treatment center), have a professional expert who monitors you and your husband’s progress, either a Counselor or mental health provider could help you manage negative feelings and identify ways to handle triggering situations.Once the safety plan is in place,  make him feel supported and not judged, saying open ended statements, like: “I am glad that you are here, please let me know what I can do to help you through this process”.  Making small changes toward a healthier living may help as well.  Exercising, eating healthier and practicing new leisure activities may be good ways to start.  Also, explore your spirituality and your husbands, looking for ways to encourage each other by joining a support group or finding people who share your spiritual beliefs."

Now she is depressed and hopeless again.","This is actually more common then we often realize, and actually understandable, as he has gone through a trauma, an unresolved existential crisis.  She was taken care of by others and now is again left alone with her own internal, and rather horrific inner struggle.In my work with CCT, or Contextual Conceptual Therapy, (see www.suicidetherapy.com) I have learned how trapped suicidal people are in their own isolation, also called a ""mysterious isolation,"" a form of self protection which cuts the off from their Self, or spirit.  And unless they address this message from their soul, accompany a guide on a journey to discover their own missing information, that is to recognize how their own uncomforted emotional pain has resulted in a coping stategy which has effectively cut themselves off from their own beauty, their Self, and their ability to receive love from themselves and others. Their attempt to kill themselves is a cry from their soul or spirit that they cannot live the life they are living any longer.  They take this literally and try to end their life, when in fact what their soul or spirit is saying is they need to begin to live the life they came here to live."
598,"After she got home from the hospital she was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now she is depressed and hopeless again.","I'm thankful to read your wife found care and that her suicide attempt wasn't successful.   While she was hospitalized, and prior to her release, your wife would've been provided in writing a self-care action plan. This typically includes things like committing to a contract 'not to harm' and what to do if he felt overwhelmed by his anger, depression, and hopelessness (e.g. call 112, call therapist, go to nearest hospital emergency department). Additionally, her protocol would've provided instructions for her taking medication(s) as directed, having a follow-up appointment(s) with her psychiatrist/psychologist/clinical social worker, and participating in some form of small group support.  If your wife's struggling as you describe, and you are feeling overwhelmed or frightened for her (your) safety, I'd encourage you to seek immediate assistance."
599,"After she got home from the hospital she was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now she is depressed and hopeless again.","This must be so difficult for both of you.  Watching someone you love suffer so profoundly can bring up lots of difficult feelings.  Without knowing what you are already doing, I have a few thoughts to share with you. First and foremost, know that you cannot fix this for him, and get support for yourself.As much as you are able, make space in your relationship for him to talk about what he is experiencing.  He might not want to talk, and that is ok.If he wants to talk, try to listen without judgement and without trying to talk him out of his feelings.  Focus on validating his feelings and just sitting with him in his pain.Let her know how you feel...that you love her, that you care, that you are concerned, that this is scary for you too, that you are here.I hope that this is helpful.  "
600,"After she got home from the hospital she was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now she is depressed and hopeless again.","I appreciate that you are concerned about your wife's emotions and want to support her as best you can right now. I imagine that you must be going through your own difficult time too. You've had a complicated shock and trauma in your life and in your marriage; it's normal for both of your emotions to move from hope to despair to fear, anger, gratitude... there is no wrong way to feel and there is no particular pattern your emotions or his will follow. Try not to assume what he is feeling but ask him instead. ""How are you doing today?"" is something that can be asked over and over again and your love and compassion for him will come through. If he has a hard time talking, you can share your observations. ""I notice you're more withdrawn. This worries me."" Certainly it will help you if you know what he's thinking and feeling because she hid her intentions to hurt herself. It's normal that you want to know. If there is depression and hopelessness, this likely was part of what led to his initial despair. There is help out there. Depression is treatable, and seeking that treatment is important right now at this vulnerable time. This is the kind of complex situation that can be assisted by a therapist who is qualified to help you both understand and manage your emotions. Whether your wife seeks help or not, I hope that you do."
601,"After she got home from the hospital she was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now she is depressed and hopeless again.","A failed suicide attempt is commonly thought of as a “cry for help,” however it can also be a serious attempt to find a permanent solution to depression, hopelessness or other feelings a person feels are unbearable. It’s wonderful that you want to support your wife, but If your wife is feeling depressed and hopeless, you can best help her by getting him to a mental health professional. Feelings of hopelessness and depression, and previous attempts at suicide are all risk factors for future suicide attempts. With a mental health professional, or in the emergency room of a hospital, your husband should be evaluated for suicidal thoughts, intent and plan, and if she is a danger to herself she should probably be hospitalized again until he is stable. Without knowing the particulars, your husband may suffer from Major Depressive Disorder or some other illness on the depressive spectrum. In that case medication could help her immensely, at which point you can offer your support and encouragement him to practice gentle self-care. And do not forget to practice it for yourself.  Remember: a suicide attempt not only affects the person, but it is an immense stressor for his or her loved ones as well. As they say, “put your oxygen mask on first.” Then you will be better able to provide your wife with calm and loving care and attention."
602,"After she got home from the hospital she was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now she is depressed and hopeless again.","The fact that you're reaching out for help here is really helpful.The first thing I would suggest is that you consider seeing a local mental health professional yourself to be able to talk about the details, how this is affecting you, and how you can hold onto you are while also being supportive to you husband.From the way that you describe this, I wonder what has changed since coming home from the hospital. Perhaps you can have a conversation with your wife this and mention that you are asking him questions to learn more about her experience and you can discuss how you notice that things were going much better when he came home from the hospital, and now things are not as good. Perhaps he can tell you about what is different so that you may know him would be most helpful to her.I also hope that you husband is still continuing with her own treatment.There may also be a local peer support telephone number for the county that you live in that they be able to help you determine whether your wife needs more immediate treatment if he is feeling hopeless again."
603,"After she got home from the hospital she was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now she is depressed and hopeless again.","Since as husband and wife your lives are closely joined, how your husband feels greatly influences the way you feel.Give yourself some time to concentrate on how you've been affected by your husband's suicide attempt.   Even if you decide against immediately telling him how you're feeling, knowing this about yourself will guide how and the topics you bring up with him.Is your wife talking easily with you?Do you have some ideas as to what is creating his feeling of hopelessness?The ideal approach would be if the two of you are able to discuss what bothers him and what bothers you.Depending on how far away you each are from such a position, you may benefit from speaking with a licensed professional therapist who can guide you and or you and your wife on opening up for discussion what feels stressful enough to merit taking one's own life."
604,"After she got home from the hospital she was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now she is depressed and hopeless again.","It seems like you are very receptive of your wife’s emotions and want to support her trough this time.  But it is also important of being aware of your emotions.  How are you feeling after the suicide attempt?  It is common to experience negative feelings while you try to make sense of the incident.  Feelings like anger, shame, guilt and fear are frequent; while, wanting to avoid, minimize and become distant from the person are parts of the defense mechanism to attempt a quick resolution.  Once you understand and overcome those feelings you may be in a better position to help your husband; who may be experiencing some negative feelings as well.First, it is important to have a safety plan in place, which includes removing harming objects from the home, knowing who to call if there’s a new attempt (either 112, or nearby treatment center), have a professional expert who monitors you and your wife’s progress, either a Counselor or mental health provider could help you manage negative feelings and identify ways to handle triggering situations.Once the safety plan is in place,  make her feel supported and not judged, saying open ended statements, like: “I am glad that you are here, please let me know what I can do to help you through this process”.  Making small changes toward a healthier living may help as well.  Exercising, eating healthier and practicing new leisure activities may be good ways to start.  Also, explore your spirituality and your husbands, looking for ways to encourage each other by joining a support group or finding people who share your spiritual beliefs."

608,"Every time I speak, he says I anger him. Also, when he’s mad at something, like work, he gets angry at me. I feel like we’re so distant from each other now. We used to laugh all the time, and I feel like he lets too much negativity in. What should I do? My kid gets affected.","It sounds to me like your husband is going through something, and I think you understand that. You might feel very helpless, sad, and disrespected at the same time. He's changed. It's unfair for him to blame you for his emotions. His mood issues are about him, not you, and he's either not recognising that or not taking responsibility for it. Are you respecting yourself here by drawing appropriate boundaries? You can let him know when you feel disrespected, and what's not okay with you.He may be experiencing depression, which often shows up as irritability in men. It could be that he's not telling you something, or he's unaware of his emotional processes. You can try a ""I'm really worried about you. You don't seem happy and I don't know how to help you. Some things are happening that aren't okay with me. Will you see a therapist?"" approach. Perhaps you could go with him the first time?  It's about a combination of compassion, self-respect and seeking professional help, I believe. If it does not work then file for divorce because if your kid watches your fighting it will affect thier mental health"

636,"There is just no communication at all between us. She sleeps constantly all day (not at night). She acts angry and unfocused and stays in her very messy room all the time. The only time she comes out is to eat. She has aches and fatigue, weight gain, hair loss and skin problems. She does not look after her health.
I don't know how to communicate with her. She is not open to any suggestions. How do I get through to her?","That sounds awful, and is clearly unsustainable.  There are some great answers that give some guidance about what might be an underlying condition.  If all physical and mental health issues are ruled out, it's time to take action.  Get backup from friends or family members if you need to, but let your daughter know you are giving her 30 days notice.  She needs to find another place to live within that time.  If she wants to stay with you, be clear that first she has to go, with a potential to return after she has been out for a good chunk of time.  Once out, she can prove to you, and more importantly to herself, that she is capable of maintaining her health and her environment.  Remember, you are going to rule out issues that would make it impossible for her to be successful; if she is in good health, her staying with you and living this way is actually harming her."
637,"My son stole my debit card and lied about it. It's not the first time he has lied. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should punish him or make him do something. I've tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. I have grounded him, but nothing works. What should I do?","You sound like a sensitive parent; I like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong. There is some key information here (I don't know your son's age, whether he spent any money, whether he put the card back, or how many times he's stolen), and my answer might be different depending on those details, but I'll give you my thoughts.I see it as every child's job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world. In order to accomplish that, many of them test limits. ""What can I get away with?"" is a question they have to find the answer to. If a child knows the rules, they're much more likely to not test limits (because they already know the limits). So, part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying. Not all kids steal, but I would say pretty much every child lies at some point. It's a normal behaviour, and most of the time it's about small things that don't matter and we don't even find out. Stealing a debit card is a bit more serious, and I'm not surprised he lied about it. If you absolutely know that he took it, it's okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it. It's appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour, so that the child doesn't do it again. The consequence should be as natural and logical as possible. The behaviour (stealing) was harmful to you, so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea. It's funny, because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad, but they know they'll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest (we don't want people to know our mistakes). It's a dilemma. If you really want to focus on the lying part, you can tell him that you won't give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day. That gives him incentive to come to you with truth. It sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth. You can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty. Put a cookie on the counter. Tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day. Then ask them later if they took the cookie. You're making honesty fun. Kids love games. Basically, there's as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative. If this is the first serious offence for your son, don't make a big deal of it; consequence him and see if he learns. If it's a pattern, that's different and you may want the input of a therapist."

In order to accomplish that, many of them test limits. ""What can I get away with?"" is a question they have to find the answer to. If a child knows the rules, they're much more likely to not test limits (because they already know the limits). So, part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying. Not all kids steal, but I would say pretty much every child lies at some point. It's a normal behaviour, and most of the time it's about small things that don't matter and we don't even find out. Stealing a debit card is a bit more serious, and I'm not surprised he lied about it. If you absolutely know that he took it, it's okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it. It's appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour, so that the child doesn't do it again. The consequence should be as natural and logical as possible. The behaviour (stealing) was harmful to you, so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea. It's funny, because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad, but they know they'll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest (we don't want people to know our mistakes). It's a dilemma. If you really want to focus on the lying part, you can tell him that you won't give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day. That gives him incentive to come to you with truth. It sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth. You can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty. Put a cookie on the counter. Tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day. Then ask them later if they took the cookie. You're making honesty fun. Kids love games. Basically, there's as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative. If this is the first serious offence for your son, don't make a big deal of it; consequence him and see if he learns. If it's a pattern, that's different and you may want the input of a therapist."

660,My 19 year old son got his 18 year old get pregnant what should I do,"Ask for a sit down with the girl and her parents.
Ask if she plans to deliver the baby or terminate.
If she will deliver the baby, ask if she is considering adoption or if she is very firm on raising the baby.
If she will raise the baby, be certain that your son is indeed the father. Even if he’s very sure, every man deserves proof of paternity. Tests can be easily purchased and used once a baby is born.
Contact a family law lawyer to write up custody agreements, child support, etc.
Counsel your son that he needs to get a job if he doesn’t already have one so he can pay child support.
Discuss with the other family any pertinent subjects, such as how each family will support the baby (I buy stuff for my grandkids and also help pay for lessons, for instance).
Discuss with your son how he can, in the future, not have accidental pregnancies happen. Also, discuss with the two young people that she will be very fertile after she gives birth, so they need to be very careful of not conceiving again if they are still romantically involved at that time.

677,why does everyone seem to think its unreasonable that i wont let my teen daughter date until she's in college,"Your intentions are good but your good intentions will end up hurting your daughter now and later.
Dating is the time when we are learning about the opposite sex as potential life partners. At 16, you can control who takes her where, what time she comes home, and guide her in ups and downs of relationships.
She has so much to learn and you have so much to teach her. Set up rules such that she can't date but every other weekend and that she can't date the same person more than three times in a row. She can only double date until she is 17 and only people you know.What I am getting at is that you will never have more control over this part of her life and you can teach date safety to her now.Please agree with me and set her free to learn. Right now you think you are protecting her but she thinks you just don't trust her.
If she breaks dating rules, she loses the next dating opportunity. Home on time or else… Call for approval for any change in itinerary… meet her when she comes in at night and hear her bubble with the fun she had…etc.
Please don't think her experience will be like your experience was. With a mother like you, hers will be better! She can call for you to come pick her up anytime.It's hard to let them grow up. But it's harder to let them grow up without learning how to choose a date…"

679,My husband is not allowing for my 15 year old daughter to have a boyfriend.He took her phone away from her. She is angry one me because I'm not doing anything.What should I do,"First of all You as a mother should have an independent Stand on this . What do you think ? Do you think it's ok for her to have a boyfriend at this age ? Know your independent thoughts about it and act likewise . If you just stand there like a spectator in this situation, your daughter would continue to believe that you don't have any sort of power in the parenting thing , she'll believe that any or all sort of power resides in the actions of her father . As parents to a child you should be equal in the eyes of the child , no one less , no one more .
If you disagree with your husband than you should talk to him about why he thinks the way he does , or you could help your husband and your daughter get on talking terms so they could negotiate what works for both of them, she could have her way while staying within the boundaries your husband wants to set for her as a parent.
And believe me taking her phone away or depriving her of the minimum independence she needs to have as a growing child ,she would only and only get frustrated and could even turn rebellious.
This wouldn't stop her a bit from Doing what she wants , she'll just start to hide things from you which is a red flag !!!
She'd do her thing but try her best that you and her father don't come to know about it , this way she could also get herself into trouble since she doesn't know what's right for her and what's not !!
Communication is the key always and forever !!"

If you just stand there like a spectator in this situation, your daughter would continue to believe that you don't have any sort of power in the parenting thing , she'll believe that any or all sort of power resides in the actions of her father . As parents to a child you should be equal in the eyes of the child , no one less , no one more .
If you disagree with your husband than you should talk to him about why he thinks the way he does , or you could help your husband and your daughter get on talking terms so they could negotiate what works for both of them, she could have her way while staying within the boundaries your husband wants to set for her as a parent.
And believe me taking her phone away or depriving her of the minimum independence she needs to have as a growing child ,she would only and only get frustrated and could even turn rebellious.
This wouldn't stop her a bit from Doing what she wants , she'll just start to hide things from you which is a red flag !!!
She'd do her thing but try her best that you and her father don't come to know about it , this way she could also get herself into trouble since she doesn't know what's right for her and what's not !!
Communication is the key always and forever !!"
681,How do I tell my teen son that he cant bring guys over and take them to his room anymore?I'm scared that he's doing something dangerous,"You talk to him. You share your fears and concerns and see what he thinks. Be honest, be gentle, ask questions.
And once you are both communicating and have at least a better-informed hold of the situation THEN determine what is best."

685,My 16 year old daughter just got her driving license but I don't want her driving without me in the car.How can I keep her from driving alone,"She has proven to be able to drive without supervision by earning the license, instead of asking how to prevent her from doing it, you should be asking yourself how to stop wanting to prevent her from doing so and statt trusting her to be a responsable driver. Watching your kid grow up is hard, but don’t try to prevent it from happening, they’ll resent your for it and in the worst case, you succeed."

689,"My teen daughter is 24/7 in her bed and doesn't get up,she doesn,t take showers has no motivation to do anything .Every time I tell her to do something,it turns into arguments.What is happening","Please get her professional help. This sounds like severe depression. If she doesn't even get out of bed on her own, and won't do anything at all, then this is extremely serious; she's probably only alive, because she just feels too sad and tired to even expend the amount of energy to end it all. Which is sadder than suicidal.She needs to know that you're not upset at her for what's happening; this isn't her fault at all. Nobody would ever choose to be this way. She isn't lazy, she's depressed and unmotivated; if her depression was treated, then she'd get out of the bed and bathe regularly, she'd hang out with her friends, she'd (probably) do chores without even being asked!
The teen in that bed isn't your daughter; it's her depression. She needs help."

693,My daughter wants me to buy her a brand new car for her birthday but I cant affor it .All of her friends parents bought their kids a car.What should I do,"Say ‘no’. As a parent, you get to decide how much of it you’ll spend and what you’ll spend it on.
She has unrealistic expectations because of her friend's families financial positions so a short and frank conversation about the budget you have for her 16th birthday is going to be an important part of helping her grow up. It sounds like a slightly sad but necessary adult lesson on how reality is often ‘a bit of a b!tch’.
I don’t know if you’re opposed to buying her a car in general, or just a ‘new’ car but what you could do is give her the option of foregoing a party and present and instead, placing any budgeted birthday funds you had put aside into a savings account for her to assist with her dream of vehicle ownership and then continue to give her the option of contributing funds each birthday/Christmas.
If she really wants a vehicle, she’ll take that option and find ways to increase the car fund or she’ll choose a vehicle within budget. She’s going to need a job anyway to pay for fuel, maintenance and insurance."

696,"My son wants a car for his birthday , but he doesn't care of his stuff.How should I handle this","Tell him it is perfectly fine to have a car. You’ll even pay for it.
However, impress upon him that due to his lack of care for his phones, he has demonstrated a serious lack of responsibility.
He wants a car? Fine. But if he wrecks it, it is his sole responsibility to provide repairs. He must also pay for his insurance.

704,I think my neighbor’s 17 year old son is checking out my teenage daughter. How can I know for sure?,"You can observe where his eyes go while she's walking around, but come on dude, let's be real, if you have a pretty daughter she's going to attract male attention.Your neighbor's son is underage presumably like your daughter. If you intend to yell at him or embarrass him for thinking she's pretty, you're going to do more harm than good. He's allowed to look you know? Why humiliate him for being a teenage male??? He isn't hurting her with his eyes. Now if he were to make remarks or gestures about her body that is a completely different story, but as long as he's looking he's doing nothing wrong."
