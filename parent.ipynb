Sometimes these feelings can rise up when you least expect them, catching you off guard. Such a response is normal, and over time the intensity of these feelings will subside. In the meantime, be kind to yourself. Researchers have found that people who are kind and compassionate to themselves have an easier time managing the day-to-day difficulties of divorce.Try not to think of the breakup as a battle. Divorce mediation is often a good alternative to courtroom proceedings.

Research shows that mediation can be beneficial for emotional satisfaction, spousal relationships and children\\x92s needs.Divorce can be a traumatic experience for children, but research suggests that most children adjust well within two years following the divorce; on the other hand, children often experience more problems when parents remain in high-conflict marriages instead of splitting up.4 During a divorce, parents can do a lot to ease the child\\x92s transition.

If appropriate, give them a few weeks\\x92 notice before moving them to a new home, or before one spouse moves out. It can be helpful to minimize changes as much as possible in the months and years following a divorce.Kids do better when they maintain close contact with both parents. Research suggests that kids who have a poor relationship with one or both parents may have a harder time dealing with family upheaval. Parent education programs that focus on improving the relationship between parents and their kids have been shown to help children cope better in the months and years following the divorce.',\n",

Your teen is likely dealing with raging hormones, rising responsibilities, and navigating the social dynamics of high school. But this does not mean your teen should lounge around the house, fail to get her chores done, and miss deadlines for school assignments. Laziness in most teens can be adjusted by creating solid rules for your teen and sticking to them, motivating your teen to get chores and other commitments done, and talking to your teen about any issues or problems she may be having at school or at home.Check in with your teen to see if there's an underlying cause. Stress, depression, and sleep problems can negatively affect motivation.\\nMake a chore list for your teenager to provide some structure. Set consequences for not following through with chores and be sure to enforce them.\\nReward your teen when they follow through with their commitments. You can offer praise as a reward, but money might be a better incentive.\",\n",

       " \"Hello, and thank you for your question. This is a very serious time. I don't mean to frighten you, but you are right to be concerned. The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. It is very important, after hospitalization,\\xa0to get\\xa0follow-up care with a professional as soon as possible. If your husband has an established therapist, this is the time to call. It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling. This is good support for him AND you.It is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. Means really do matter.\\xa0 So, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. You can't remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means he used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. This is where your support system can help out. People can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is over.If you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your husband about going back to the hospital. If he refuses, you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesn't want to. I know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save his life. Calling 9-1-1 is always\\xa0a\\xa0good option if you are not sure. Usually a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours or days. Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. But, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again. So, it is always good to have a plan. If you want more information, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They will always answer: 1-800-273-8255. They can help you create a specific safety plan. I do hope things work out alright. Be well.\",\n",

      "GOD: First you try to accept them as they are .When your children come out to you about their gender identity or sexuality, it can be a big step for them. One that's filled with fear, anxiety about your reaction, and hope that you will love them no matter what you are about to say. You need to believe your child and make this known to them. It is easy to assume clichés or go into a space of denial by saying things like \"it's just a phase\" or \"they're confused,\" especially if your child is young. However, saying these words can irreparably damage your relationship with them.

I'd take her phone at night if she isn't sleeping well and getting bad grades.I would talk to her about online predators and mention to her the tactics they use and to not share personal information with strangers. If she's exploring her sexuality it's not that big of a deal as long as you explain to her the dangers of real life sex and have a good idea of where she's going when she goes out.

Do your best to keep any conflict away from the kids. Ongoing parental conflict increases kids risk of psychological and social problems.Its often helpful for divorcing parents to come up with a plan and present it to their children together. And, keep the lines of communication open. Kids benefit from having honest conversations about the changes their family is experiencing.In many cases, sudden change can be hard on children. If appropriate, give them a few weeks notice before moving them to a new home, or before one spouse moves out. It can be helpful to minimize changes as much as possible in the months and years following a divorce.Kids do better when they maintain close contact with both parents. Research suggests that kids who have a poor relationship with one or both parents may have a harder time dealing with family upheaval.

If parents have unresolved issues, struggles, or challenges, then it makes it harder for them to give the kid what the kid deserves. It is not fair to the kid. Children deserve a good role model. It would be great if the parent can teach the kid financial literacy from a young age it really gives the kid an advantage in life.\n",

Your teen is likely dealing with raging hormones, rising responsibilities, and navigating the social dynamics of high school. But this does not mean your teen should lounge around the house, fail to get her chores done, and miss deadlines for school assignments. Laziness in most teens can be adjusted by creating solid rules for your teen and sticking to them, motivating your teen to get chores and other commitments done, and talking to your teen about any issues or problems she may be having at school or at home.Check in with your teen to see if there's an underlying cause. Stress, depression, and sleep problems can negatively affect motivation.\n",
